        <h1>Railway developments<br>
            Bondamunda railway station (IR Station code:BNDM) is an important railway station under Chakradharpur division of South Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways. It is a station on the Tatanagar–Bilaspur section of Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line.

            It connects Sini and Chakardharpur on east direction, Ranchi, Hatia on north direction, Jharsuguda on south direction and Barsuan and Bimlagarh on south direction.

            Asia's second largest railway yard is located here. The Yard was constructed to feed the raw material and finished product requirements of Rourkela Steel Plant, established in collaboration with Germany.Exchange Yard was constructed for exchange of railway wagons between Rourkela Steel Plant and Indian Railways. Three more Yards were constructed Reception Yard, Classification Yard and Departure Yard for sorting out railway wagons according to the destination. This was the chief marshaling yard of Chakradharpur Division. After the introduction of block-rake concept in Indian Railways, the marshaling yards lost their function. So Reception Yard was shutdown and Classification Yard is now used as a stabling yard.
